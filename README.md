===============

node js utilities (proxies etc), mainly for developing purposes


simplecssproxy.js :
  
  -Watch this video to understand it better: http://youtu.be/ZuozcpaCVEY

  -It is a proxy server that allows you to first catch and then edit some remote css files 
    as if they were running in your local machine.

  -If you just want to edit the CSS files and don't want to worry about setting up, compiling and 
    deploying big and complicated java projects in a local webserver it is ideal for you.
